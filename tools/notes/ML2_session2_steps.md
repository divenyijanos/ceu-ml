# ML2 - Session 2

## 1:

- Quiz#1
- discussed tree-based models
- cont with bike share

## 2:
- estimate more flexible models on bike share
- realized that perfect trees in an RF result in non-perfect aggregated estimate
- cv for RF
    -- took too much time,
    -- "neg_mean_squared_log_error" needed updated sklearn version!
- xgboost with categories: no time to estimate a useful model

## 3:
- heart failure prediction with own work submitting to Kaggle
- no time for imputation

## Lessons

- I messed up the Kaggle part, have to prepare better for such student activity
- it is hard to build on anything they learnt before: not even Recall was a known metric, not to mention ROC curve
